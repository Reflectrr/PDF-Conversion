The key transformations were aldol reaction of methyl acetoacetate with the aldehyde, diastereoselective reduction of the resulting \u03b2-hydroxy ketone, and the stereoinversion at the C6 position. Comparison of the 1H NMR data between the four synthetic products and the degraded product revealed the relative stereostructure of the C1-C13 fragment of symbiodinolide. INTRODUCTION Integrated use of a spectroscopic method and chemical synthesis is well recognized as a reliable approach to the structural elucidation of natural products.1 In particular, if the target molecule has a huge molecular size or a number of functional groups, the chemical synthesis is often required for the unambiguous configurational assignment.2 Symbiodinolide (1, Figure 1), a 62-membered polyol macrolide marine natural product, was isolated from the 80% aqueous ethanol extract of the cultured dinoflagellate Symbiodinium sp. by one of the authors (D.U.).3 This natural product exhibits voltage-dependent N-type Ca2+ channel-opening activity at 7 nM and COX-1 inhibition effect at 2 \u03bcM (65% inhibition). The planar structure of symbiodinolide (1) was assigned by the detailed 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques. However, the stereostructure of 1 has not been elucidated yet because of its complicated molecular structure characterized by 61 stereocenters and molecular weight of 2860. Therefore, we are now examining the degradation of natural symbiodinolide (1)3,4 and chemical synthesis of each fragment including the stereoisomers5 toward the complete stereochemical establishment of 1. Previously, as a degradation of symbiodinolide (1), we carried out the methanolysis and subsequent oxidative cleavage with Grubbs II catalyst/NaClO to yield the C1-C13 fragment 2 (Scheme 1).4a,c Herein, as a part of our efforts toward the complete configurational determination of symbiodinolide (1), we describe the stereo-structural analysis of the degraded product 2, and stereo-divergent and stereoselective synthesis of all four possible diastereomers of the C1-C13 fragment 2,6 which has established the relative stereostructure of this fragment. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Stereochemical Analysis of the Degraded Product 2. Prior to starting the synthesis of the C1-C13 fragment, we first analyzed the stereostructure of the degraded product 2 to reduce the number of the possible diastereomers of this fragment. As shown in Figure 2a, the chemical shifts of the H-5 and H-7 in the 1H NMR spectrum were the same value (3.97 ppm in D2O); in addition, the two coupling constants were also the same (3J5,6 and 3J6,7 = 4.5 Hz). Comparison of these results with universal NMR databases for 1,2,3-triols reported by Kishi and co-workers7 indicates that the relative stereochemical relationships at the C5 and C7 positions to the C6 position are the same, that is, syn/syn or anti/anti. Thus, the possible diastereomers of the C1-C13 fragment were narrowed down from the eight potential diastereomers and found to be four, which are described as 2a-2d in Figure 2b. We next examined the synthesis of all four of these possible diastereomers 2a-2d in the unified strategy.8 Stereodivergent Synthetic Plan of 2a-2b. The unified and stereodivergent synthetic plan of 2a-2d is depicted in Scheme 2. Aldol reaction of methyl acetoacetate (3) with of 2b-2d, a change from the TBS protective group to a less-hindered and more easily removed group in the final step was needed. Removal of the TBS moiety of 17 was carried out with TBAF/AcOH in MeCN at 60 \u00b0C to give diol 20 in 86% yield (Scheme 6).18 Treatment of 20 with TESOTf/2,6-lutidine, followed by selective removal of the primary TES moiety, provided secondary TES ether 21. TEMPO oxidation13 of the allylic alcohol 21 and subsequent removal of the PMB group afforded unsaturated aldehyde 22 in 76% yield in two steps. Finally, when 22 was treated with TiCl4 17 at -30 \u00b0C to room temperature, the acetonide deprotection and subsequent removal of the TES moiety proceeded in one-pot to produce the tetraol 2a in 74% yield. Stereoselective Synthesis of 2b. We next examined the stereoselective synthesis of the second target molecule 2b, which is the C6-epimer of 2a. We envisioned the stereo-inversion at the C6 position by the oxidation-reduction process. Thus, selective protection of the primary hydroxy group of the diol 20 with TESCl/imidazole yielded the secondary alcohol, which was subjected to the TPAP oxidation19 to afford ketone 23 (Scheme 7). Diastereoselective reduction of 23 with NaBH4 proceeded successfully to provide the desired alcohol 24 in 98% yield as the sole diastereomer. This stereochemical outcome is in line with a Felkin-Anh model, which is doubly effected by the C5 and C7 stereogenic centers. The 1H NMR spectrum of 24 was clearly different from that of the secondary alcohol obtained in the first step Scheme 2. Stereodivergent Synthetic Plan of 2a-2d from 20, which resulted in the configurational confirmation at the C6 stereogenic center of 24. TES protection of the resulting secondary hydroxy moiety of 24, followed by selective removal of the primary TES group, yielded alcohol 25. Oxidation of 25 with TEMPO/PhI(OAc)2 13 and subsequent removal of the PMB group gave unsaturated aldehyde 26 in 82% yield in two steps. Stepwise deprotection of 26, that is, removal of the acetonide moiety by TiCl4 17 and the TES group by HF\u00b7pyr, furnished the second target molecule 2b. Stereoselective Synthesis of 2c and 2d. Having completed the stereoselective and stereodivergent synthesis of the first and second target molecules 2a and 2b bearing the syn relationships at the C3 and C5 positions, we next commenced the synthesis of the third and fourth target molecules 2c and 2d with the C3/C5 anti correlations. The stereoselective synthesis of 2c is illustrated in Scheme 8. Treatment of the \u03b2-hydroxy ketone 11 with NaBH(OAc)3 20 furnished the desired anti-diol 27 in 95% yield as a single diastereomer, as judged by its 1H NMR spectrum, which was clearly different from that of the syn-diol 14. Further transformation of 27 toward 2c was similar to that used in the synthesis of 2a. Protection of the resulting diol moiety of 27 and desilylation afforded diol 28. The diol 28 was transformed to unsaturated aldehyde 29 by the following four-step sequence: (1) bis-silylation, (2) selective desilylation of the primary TES moiety, (3) TEMPO oxidation13 of the allylic alcohol, and (4) removal of the PMB group. Simultaneous removal of the acetonide and TES moieties was performed with TiCl4 17 to provide the third target molecule 2c in 44% yield. The stereocontrolled synthesis of 2d, whose synthetic route was analogous to that of 2b, is shown in Scheme 9. The alcohol 28, which was the key synthetic intermediate toward 2c, was converted to ketone 30 through the selective silylation of the primary alcohol and TPAP oxidation19 of the secondary alcohol. The ketone 30 was reduced with NaBH4 to give alcohol 31 as the sole diastereomer. The resulting stereo-chemistry at the C6 position of 31 was confirmed by comparing the 1H NMR spectra between 31 and the secondary alcohol synthesized in the first transformation from 28. Acetonide 32, which was synthesized from the alcohol 31 in 54% overall yield in four steps, was deprotected with TiCl4 17 to provide the fourth target molecule 2d in 47% yield. Relative Stereostructure of the C1-C13 Fragment. With all four possible diastereomers 2a-2d in hand, we next compared these 1H NMR data with those of the degraded product 2. As described in Table 1, the 1H NMR chemical shifts of the synthetic 2b were found to be in full agreement with those of the degraded product 2.21 On the other hand, the 1H NMR chemical shifts of the synthetic 2a, 2c, and 2d were clearly different from those of the degraded product 2, respectively. Especially, the chemical shifts of two geminal protons at the C4 position of 2a, 2c, and 2d were different to each other, respectively, whereas the chemical shifts of these protons of 2 and 2b were found to be the same. Therefore, the relative stereostructure of the C1-C13 fragment of symbiodi-nolide (1) was elucidated to be that described in 2b. CONCLUSION First, we have analyzed the 1H NMR chemical shifts and coupling constants of the degraded product 2 obtained from natural symbiodinolide (1) and proposed its four possible Scheme 4. Synthesis of 14 and Its Stereochemical diastereomers 2a-2d by comparing with the universal NMR databases reported by Kishi\u2019s research group. Next, we have examined the stereodivergent synthesis of 2a-2d in the unified manner. Thus, the \u03b2-hydroxy ketone 11, which would be the key common synthetic intermediate of 2a-2d, was synthesized by aldol reaction between methyl acetoacetate (3) and the aldehyde derived from 10. Diastereoselective reduction of 11 provided the syn-diol 14 (by Et2BOMe/NaBH4) and the anti-diol 27 (by NaBH(OAc)3), respectively. Deprotection and oxidation of the allylic alcohol moiety of 14 produced the first target molecule 2a. The second target molecule 2b was synthesized via the stereoinversion at the C6 position by diastereoselective reduction of the ketone 23. In the similar synthetic route, the third and fourth target molecules 2c and 2d were yielded from the anti-diol 27, respectively and stereo-selectively. Comparison of the 1H NMR data of the synthetic 2a-2d with those of the degraded product 2 determined the relative stereochemistry of the C1-C13 fragment of symbiodinolide (1) to be depicted in 2b.

After the detailed consideration of the 1H NMR data analysis, we concluded that we could not exclude the possibility of the combination of anti (C5/C6) and anti (C6/C7) relationships.

    "abstract": "Four possible diastereomers of the C1-C13 fragment of symbiodinolide, which were proposed by thestereostructural analysis of the degraded product, were synthesized in a stereodivergent and stereoselective manner. The key transformations were aldol reaction of methyl acetoacetate with the aldehyde, diastereoselective reduction of the resulting \u03b2-hydroxy ketone, and the stereoinversion at the C6 position. Comparison of the 1H NMR data between the four synthetic products and the degraded product revealed the relative stereostructure of the C1-C13 fragment of symbiodinolide.",
    "introduction": [
        "Integrated use of a spectroscopic method and chemical synthesis is well recognized as a reliable approach to the structural elucidation of natural products.1 In particular, if the target molecule has a huge molecular size or a number of functional groups, the chemical synthesis is often required for the unambiguous configurational assignment.2",
        "Symbiodinolide (1, Figure 1), a 62-membered polyol macrolide marine natural product, was isolated from the 80% aqueous ethanol extract of the cultured dinoflagellate Symbiodinium sp. by one of the authors (D.U.).3 This natural product exhibits voltage-dependent N-type Ca2+ channel-opening activity at 7 nM and COX-1 inhibition effect at 2 \u03bcM (65% inhibition). The planar structure of symbiodinolide (1) was assigned by the detailed 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques. However, the stereostructure of 1 has not been elucidated yet because of its complicated molecular structure characterized by 61 stereocenters and molecular weight of 2860. Therefore, we are now examining the degradation of natural symbiodinolide (1)3,4 and chemical synthesis of each fragment including the stereoisomers5 toward the complete stereochemical establishment of 1. Previously, as a degradation of symbiodinolide (1), we carried out the methanolysis and subsequent oxidative cleavage with Grubbs II catalyst/NaClO to yield the C1-C13 fragment 2 (Scheme 1).4a,c Herein, as a part of our efforts toward the complete configurational determination of symbiodinolide (1), we describe the stereo-structural analysis of the degraded product 2, and stereo-divergent and stereoselective synthesis of all four possible diastereomers of the C1-C13 fragment 2,6 which has established the relative stereostructure of this fragment."

        "Stereochemical Analysis of the Degraded Product 2. Prior to starting the synthesis of the C1-C13 fragment, we first analyzed the stereostructure of the degraded product 2 to reduce the number of the possible diastereomers of this fragment. As shown in Figure 2a, the chemical shifts of the H-5 and H-7 in the 1H NMR spectrum were the same value (3.97 ppm in D2O); in addition, the two coupling constants were also the same (3J5,6 and 3J6,7 = 4.5 Hz). Comparison of these results with universal NMR databases for 1,2,3-triols reported by Kishi and co-workers7 indicates that the relative stereochemical relationships at the C5 and C7 positions to the C6 position are the same, that is, syn/syn or anti/anti. Thus, the possible diastereomers of the C1-C13 fragment were narrowed down from the eight potential diastereomers and found to be four, which are described as 2a-2d in Figure 2b. We next examined the synthesis of all four of these possible diastereomers 2a-2d in the unified strategy.8",
        "Stereodivergent Synthetic Plan of 2a-2b. The unified and stereodivergent synthetic plan of 2a-2d is depicted in of 2b-2d, a change from the TBS protective group to a less-hindered and more easily removed group in the final step was needed.",
        "Removal of the TBS moiety of 17 was carried out with TBAF/AcOH in MeCN at 60 \u00b0C to give diol 20 in 86% yield (Scheme 6).18 Treatment of 20 with TESOTf/2,6-lutidine, followed by selective removal of the primary TES moiety, provided secondary TES ether 21. TEMPO oxidation13 of the allylic alcohol 21 and subsequent removal of the PMB group afforded unsaturated aldehyde 22 in 76% yield in two steps. Finally, when 22 was treated with TiCl4 17 at -30 \u00b0C to room temperature, the acetonide deprotection and subsequent removal of the TES moiety proceeded in one-pot to produce the tetraol 2a in 74% yield.",
        "Stereoselective Synthesis of 2b. We next examined the stereoselective synthesis of the second target molecule 2b, which is the C6-epimer of 2a. We envisioned the stereo-inversion at the C6 position by the oxidation-reduction process. Thus, selective protection of the primary hydroxy group of the diol 20 with TESCl/imidazole yielded the secondary alcohol, which was subjected to the TPAP oxidation19 to afford ketone 23 (Scheme 7). Diastereoselective reduction of 23 with NaBH4 proceeded successfully to provide the desired alcohol 24 in 98% yield as the sole diastereomer. This stereochemical outcome is in line with a Felkin-Anh model, which is doubly effected by the C5 and C7 stereogenic centers. The 1H NMR spectrum of 24 was clearly different from that of the secondary alcohol obtained in the first step from 20, which resulted in the configurational confirmation at the C6 stereogenic center of 24. TES protection of the resulting secondary hydroxy moiety of 24, followed by selective removal of the primary TES group, yielded alcohol 25. Oxidation of 25 with TEMPO/PhI(OAc)2 13 and subsequent removal of the PMB group gave unsaturated aldehyde 26 in 82% yield in two steps. Stepwise deprotection of 26, that is, removal of the acetonide moiety by TiCl4 17 and the TES group by HF\u00b7pyr, furnished the second target molecule 2b.",
        "Stereoselective Synthesis of 2c and 2d. Having completed the stereoselective and stereodivergent synthesis of the first and second target molecules 2a and 2b bearing the syn relationships at the C3 and C5 positions, we next commenced the synthesis of the third and fourth target molecules 2c and 2d with the C3/C5 anti correlations. The stereoselective synthesis of 2c is illustrated in Scheme 8. Treatment of the \u03b2-hydroxy ketone 11 with NaBH(OAc)3 20 furnished the desired anti-diol 27 in 95% yield as a single diastereomer, as judged by its 1H NMR spectrum, which was clearly different from that of the syn-diol 14. Further transformation of 27 toward 2c was similar to that used in the synthesis of 2a. Protection of the resulting diol moiety of 27 and desilylation afforded diol 28. The diol 28 was transformed to unsaturated aldehyde 29 by the following four-step sequence: (1) bis-silylation, (2) selective desilylation of the primary TES moiety, (3) TEMPO oxidation13 of the allylic alcohol, and (4) removal of the PMB group. Simultaneous removal of the acetonide and TES moieties was performed with TiCl4 17 to provide the third target molecule 2c in 44% yield.",
        "The stereocontrolled synthesis of 2d, whose synthetic route was analogous to that of 2b, is shown in Scheme 9. The alcohol 28, which was the key synthetic intermediate toward 2c, was converted to ketone 30 through the selective silylation of the primary alcohol and TPAP oxidation19 of the secondary alcohol. The ketone 30 was reduced with NaBH4 to give alcohol 31 as the sole diastereomer. The resulting stereo-chemistry at the C6 position of 31 was confirmed by comparing the 1H NMR spectra between 31 and the secondary alcohol synthesized in the first transformation from 28. Acetonide 32, which was synthesized from the alcohol 31 in 54% overall yield in four steps, was deprotected with TiCl4 17 to provide the fourth target molecule 2d in 47% yield.",
        "Relative Stereostructure of the C1-C13 Fragment. With all four possible diastereomers 2a-2d in hand, we next compared these 1H NMR data with those of the degraded product 2. As described in Table 1, the 1H NMR chemical shifts of the synthetic 2b were found to be in full agreement with those of the degraded product 2.21 On the other hand, the 1H NMR chemical shifts of the synthetic 2a, 2c, and 2d were clearly different from those of the degraded product 2, respectively. Especially, the chemical shifts of two geminal protons at the C4 position of 2a, 2c, and 2d were different to each other, respectively, whereas the chemical shifts of these protons of 2 and 2b were found to be the same. Therefore, the relative stereostructure of the C1-C13 fragment of symbiodi-nolide (1) was elucidated to be that described in 2b."

    "conclusion": [
        "First, we have analyzed the 1H NMR chemical shifts and coupling constants of the degraded product 2 obtained from natural symbiodinolide (1) and proposed its four possible diastereomers 2a-2d by comparing with the universal NMR databases reported by Kishi\u2019s research group. Next, we have examined the stereodivergent synthesis of 2a-2d in the unified manner. Thus, the \u03b2-hydroxy ketone 11, which would be the key common synthetic intermediate of 2a-2d, was synthesized by aldol reaction between methyl acetoacetate (3) and the aldehyde derived from 10. Diastereoselective reduction of 11 provided the syn-diol 14 (by Et2BOMe/NaBH4) and the anti-diol 27 (by NaBH(OAc)3), respectively. Deprotection and oxidation of the allylic alcohol moiety of 14 produced the first target molecule 2a. The second target molecule 2b was synthesized via the stereoinversion at the C6 position by diastereoselective reduction of the ketone 23. In the similar synthetic route, the third and fourth target molecules 2c and 2d were yielded from the anti-diol 27, respectively and stereo-selectively. Comparison of the 1H NMR data of the synthetic 2a-2d with those of the degraded product 2 determined the relative stereochemistry of the C1-C13 fragment of symbiodinolide (1) to be depicted in 2b."

(8) In ref 4c, we reported that the relative stereostructural relationships of the C5/C6 and C6/C7 could be proposed as syn and syn, respectively. After the detailed consideration of the 1H NMR data analysis, we concluded that we could not exclude the possibility of the combination of anti (C5/C6) and anti (C6/C7) relationships. Therefore, we decided to synthesize 2a-2d for the unambiguous configurational determination. (9) Parikh, J. R.; Doering, W. v. E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967, 89, 5505.
